  "title": "Machine Learning Image Classifier",
  "overview": "A Python-based image classification system with a GUI for real-time inference. It is developed with a modular architecture to support training, evaluation, and comparison of multiple models. As Project Lead, I designed the overall application architecture, implemented three machine learning model classes (Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbours), handled model serialisation and developed data preprocessing pipelines. The project also includes automation tools for model optimisation and hyperparameter tuning to streamline experimentation and improve model performance.",
